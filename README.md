# Microphi

Microphi is a Deno monorepo containing all utilities for Deno that we created while working on [Microgamma](https://www.microgamma.io).

## Packages

- [@microphi/debug](libs/debug/) - A feature-rich debug logging utility for Deno with colored output, timestamps, regex namespace matching, and callback support, inspired by the 'debug' package.
